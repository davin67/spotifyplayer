Sentry provides several configuration options to create a crash-rate alert based on your organization's needs.

### Environment

Specify which <PlatformLink to="/configuration/environments/">environment(s)</PlatformLink> will use this particular alert rule. This control filters on the `environment` tag in your events. This filter is helpful because the urgency and workflows you apply to production alerts might differ from those you apply to alerts originating from your QA environment, for example.

The “Env:” dropdown list here has the same environments that are available for the selected project in the global “Environment” dropdown (this does not include hidden environments). Selecting "All" is equivalent to having no environment filter.

### Tags & Attributes

Add filters in the field provided to narrow down what you'll be alerted about. Crash rate alert support release tag to narrow down your alert to a specific release.

## Crash Rate (Function + Time Interval)

Depending on the type of crash-rate alert you’ve selected, the corresponding function is built into the alert and the settings aren't displayed. For example, if you select “Crash Free Sessions Rate”, that translates to the function, `percentage(sessions_crashed, sessions)`. Since editing this function would change the nature of the alert, it is not editable and thus hidden.

### Functions for Alerting

Both types of crash-rate alerts use the percentage function, which calculates the crash free percentage on either the user or the sessions.

### Time Interval

Choose the time period over which to evaluate your metric. Your choices range between 30 minutes and one day. Sentry evaluates the specified window each minute. For example, if you specify an hour time window, Sentry evaluates:

- At 3:00pm: 2:00pm - 3:00pm
- At 3:01pm: 2:01pm - 3:01pm
- At 3:02pm: 2:02pm - 3:02pm
- ...

## Thresholds

Thresholds are numerical values that help define an alert trigger. These numerical values are labeled:

- Critical
- Warning
- Resolved

You must set the “Warning” threshold so that it’s triggered before the “Critical” threshold. When Sentry evaluates an alert, the alert’s status is updated to the highest severity trigger that matches. If you don’t set a “Resolved” threshold, the alert automatically resolves when it's no longer breaching the “Critical” or “Warning” conditions. You can also resolve alerts manually.

### Auto-Resolve

By default, crash rate alerts are resolved automatically when the specified crash free rate is no longer breaching the “Critical” or “Warning” conditions. However, you can set a different resolution threshold. For example, suppose a normal level of sessions crash free rate for your app is above 90%, and you want to be alerted when that rate falls below 85%. You might want the alert to resolve only if the sessions crash free rate goes back above 90%, not above 85%. By setting the "Resolved" threshold this way, if the sessions crash free rate goes back up to only 87%, which you’d consider problematic even though it’s above your alert threshold percentage, the alert won't resolve.

## Actions

Actions define how you and your team will be alerted:

- Send an email to a member or team. If sent to a member, the member's personal project alert opt-out settings are overridden.
- Send a [Slack](/product/integrations/notification-incidents/slack/) notification.
- Trigger a [PagerDuty](/product/integrations/notification-incidents/pagerduty/) incident.
- Send a [Microsoft Teams](/product/integrations/notification-incidents/msteams/) notification.
- Send a request using [internal integrations](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#internal-integrations).

## Rule Name

Give your alert a descriptive name, such as the team affected and the topic of the alert. For example, "Frontend Release Health", "Backend Crash Free Rate", or "Backend Users Crash Free Rate".

## Team

You can choose a team to associate with an alert so that members of that team can edit this alert. Note that you can only make this association if you are a member of the team. If no team is selected, anybody can edit the alert.
