## SDK Support

You can use Dynamic Sampling rules in any project and with any SDK for both error and transaction rules. To sample distributed traces, however, you need to use one of the supported SDKs:

- **Python:** 1.4.0 or later
- **JavaScript:** 6.13.0 or later
- **Apple Cocoa:** 7.3.0 or later
- **Java and Android:** 5.2.0 or later

## Current Limitations

The following section describes the known limitations and functionality specifics that can create challenges when you're writing dynamic sampling rules.

### Trace rules can only select based on the attributes of the initial transaction

When sampling traces the decision on whether to keep or throw away a trace needs to be taken when the first transaction
of the trace is seen. This in turn means that for transaction traces only the attributes of the first transaction can
participate in the sampling decision.

In conclusion all trace rules use the attributes (release, environment, etc.) of initiating transaction of the trace.

### Changing trace attributes in secondary transactions

Related to the previously discuss issue about trace rules, setting the transaction, the release or the environment in a
transaction will have no influence on a trace sampling decision if the transaction is not the first transaction in the
trace.

When using transaction or error rules setting the transaction, the release, etc. will have the expected effect on
sampling regardless if the event is the first or not in the trace.

### Limited number of selection attributes

Although transactions and errors have a lot of attributes only a limited number of them are
available in the rules. We are working to expand the availability of attributes for both
Error and Transaction rules.

Trace rules have an even stricter amount of attributes available. This is a deliberate decision,
in order to support more attributes in trace transaction we would need carry additional data in
all messages belonging to a trace. We are currently investigating ways on how to offer maximum
flexibility in writing rules while keeping data

### Arbitrary logical composition for rule conditions

At the moment rules containing more than one condition use a logical `and` for each condition.
Multiple values for a condition use a logical `or` condition for matching .

The decision to implement it like that was taken from the desire to keep the ui simple while still being able to cover
all common scenarios.

Having multiple arguments within a single condition use the or operator is what we commonly want since an attribute
generally has one value and having an `and` condition would not make a lot of sense (e.g. the environment attribute
could be `prod` or `dev` but it could not be `prod` and `dev` at the same time).

While it is useful to have multiple conditions joined both with an `and` operator and an `or` operator. We can simulate
an `or` operator by creating two rules with the same sampling rate.

For example if we want to sample at 50% errors originating from the environment "production" `and` having release "1.2"
we can create a rule with:

```
Sample at 50%  relese: ["1.2"] , environment: ["production"]
```

If we wanted to sample at 50% errors originating either from the environment "production" `or` having release "1.2" we
could still do it by writing two rules and having them one after the other

```
Sample at 50%  environment: ["production"]
Sample at 50%  relese: ["1.2"]
```


### Rule specificity is exclusively determined by the rule order

When multiple rules match a particular event sentry always uses the first rule that matches the event.

This gives a very easy to understand algorithm that does the obvious thing and does not surprise users.
As a consequence more specific rules should be places ahead of less specific rules in order to have an effect.

For example if we would want to sample events coming from the production environment at 10%, but we would like
to keep all production events from the last release we would need to specify the rules in the following order:

```
Sample at 100%  relese: ["1.2"] , environment: ["production"]
Sample at 10%  environment: ["production"]
```

Reversing the conditions would sample all production events at 10%.

### Transaction trace rules and transaction rules may interact in surprising ways

Generally the first rule that matches an event is selected and used for a sampling decision.

There is an exception when the project has both trace rules and transaction or event rules.

If a transaction happens to match both a trace rule and a transaction rule a sampling decision will
be taken twice having the net effect of sampling at the product of the two rules, the following example
will help clarify the behaviour.

Let's say we have a transaction originating from a trace that has the release set to 1.2. This transaction has
the environment set to "production".

Now if we have a trace rule specifying that "traces from release 1.2 should be sampled at 20%" and we also have
a transaction rule specifying that "transactions from environment production should be sampled at 40%" the system
will first match the transaction with the trace rule and will sample it at 20%, if the event is not discarded it will
end up being also matched against the transaction rules and will be further sampled at 40%. Effectively only 0.4*0.2 = 0.08
(i.e. 8%) of the transactions of this type will be kept.

This is a corner case that we don't anticipate to happen a lot in practice, but it is good to keep in mind that if we have
both transaction and transaction trace rules
