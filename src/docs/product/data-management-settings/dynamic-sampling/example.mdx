The following examples illustrate when different sampling methods might be useful. In the examples below, the system is composed of:
- UI clients that are mobile applications running on our clients' phones, which call
- an API backend, which further calls
- an internal service (S1)

The system is replicated on multiple servers running differing versions of the software. Two versions of our mobile application, UI-1.1 and UI-1.2, have been released. Not all clients have yet upgraded to the last version (UI-1.2).

A new backend API, release API-2.0, has also been recently released. This API should work with both the new and old clients. However, release API-2.0 has been deployed to only one server, since its performance under production load is not yet known. As a result, servers are running both release API-1.0 and release API-2.0.

Service (S1) is running only on release S1-1.4, and has been stable until now.

In the scenario above, four traces (T1..T4) representing all possible paths that requests from users can go through.
Users running UI 1.1. create traces like T1 that goes through API 1.0 or like T2  which go through API 2.0.
Similarly, the users running UI 1.2 create traces like T3 and T4.
The server running S1 service is reached by all four traces.

After the deployment of the new mobile application UI 1.2 and the updated backend API 2.0 the system occasionally generates errors.

We will discuss to scenarios where different types of sampling may be useful.

### Detecting Bugs Introduced in API 2.0

Immediately after releasing a new version of an application it is common to focus our attention on it.
After releasing API 2.0 we would likely want to record transactions and events that pass through a server running API 2.0
with a much higher frequency than for transactions running through our fully tested and stable servers running API 1.0.

We have two choices sampling based on trace information and sampling based on the event (transaction or error) information.
Since all traces originate in the UI and therefore only contain information about the UI release number we have no way of
writing trace rules that select transactions passing through API 2.0 servers. To select transactions from API-2.0, we
need to base the rules on the event data.

For targeting specific versions of a software in services that do not initiate a trace, as is the case in our example for
the API and S1 layers we need to write event based sampling rules. In our case we would write an event rule for
transactions that select release API 2.0.

**When launching new versions of a system we typically want to temporarily turn up the amount of messages we keep from
the new system, so we can catch any regressions introduced.**

### Understanding Bugs Caused by the Interaction Between Multiple Systems

After deploying the new version of the mobile app (UI 1.2) and the api (API 2.0) we notice that we are getting errors from
S1. This is rather unexpected since S1 1.4 has been deployed for a long time and has been operating flawlessly until now.

Looking at errors and transactions in isolation doesn't reveal any pattern.
To understand what is going on we need to enable sampling by trace information to try to understand exactly in what
circumstances the error occur. If we sample by trace information, we are able to see all transactions belonging to a
trace and figure out all the interactions that ultimately caused the error.

Here is a sequence of traces that we recorded from which we can get a hint of the problem.

In the table below we Marked with `T` transaction events and with `E` error events.

|Nr.|System|Type|Release|
|: - |: - |: - |: - |
|1 | UI | T| 1.1 |
|2 | API | T | API-1.0  |
|3 | S1 | T | S1-1.4 |
|4 | S1 | E | S1-1.4 |

Looking through the traces we notice that the traces that generate errors go through UI 1.2, API 1.0 and S1 1.4
generate errors.

We realize that when we tested the new UI 1.2 we did test the new features with the new API 2.0.
We assumed that UI 1.2 will work with the old API 1.0 and we did some smoke tests to check that everything seems fine,
but we have not tested the interaction in detail.

After further investigation, we realise that in version UI 1.2 an additional parameter was
introduced that is unknown to API 1.0, since API 1.0 was released before UI 1.2.
API 1.0 does not know how to handle the new parameter, so it passes it unprocessed downstream to S1
(likely because of an issue with input validation to the API layer), S1 receives an unprocessed parameter from API 1.0
and since it doesn't know how to handle it, it generates an error.

This is an integration error, each system individually works correctly within the constraints of its accepted
input but since the interface between UI and API has changed between UI 1.1->UI 1.2 and API 1.0->API 2.0, API 1.0
incorrectly handles unexpected input from UI 1.2 and passes invalid data to S1.

Errors that involve interaction among multiple systems running various versions of the software can be frustratingly
difficult to understand in the absence of distributed traces.

With trace sampling, the sampling decision is based on the trace state. All transactions within a trace are kept or
discarded together, so you can understand the path of the request through the system and clearly identify integration
conditions that lead to errors.

To quickly identify the cause of this type of errors having access to the whole trace is very useful and this is what
trace sampling offers.

**When sampling using trace information we have the guarantee that all messages belonging to a trace
will be sampled together allowing us to understand inter system interactions.**
