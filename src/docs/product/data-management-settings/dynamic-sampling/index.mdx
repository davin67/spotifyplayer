Dynamic sampling addresses the need to easily change and manage what data is collected after your application has been deployed or published. Compared with SDK sampling, dynamic sampling enables more sophisticated sampling decisions that span multiple transactions.

When you select your sampling type, you'll find that dynamic sampling:

- helps you prioritize impactful data
- enables observation of complete traces
- maintains a representative sample
- requires minimal configuration and no redeployment

## Getting Started
Quickly get up to speed and see [how to use dynamic sampling](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/getting-started/).


## Sampling Types

Sentry offers the ability to sample in two different ways:

1. [Client-side in your SDK](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/sampling/) during SDK initialization
2. [Dynamic sampling rates](./configuration/) in Filters & Sampling for your Project in sentry.io.

Learn more about our [sampling types and the benefits of each](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/sampling-types/).

## Dynamic Sampling Configuration

Dynamic sampling operates on both error events and transaction events. When creating rules for transactions, you can
further determine whether to apply dynamic sampling rules to transactions independently or as part of a trace. Learn
more about [how the rules are applied](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/configuration/).

## Examples of Dynamic Sampling

Determining which type of dynamic sampling to set varies based on what you're trying to accomplish. Review our
[comprehensive examples](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/example/) that illustrates when
different sampling methods might be useful.

## Current Implementation Status

Look at [the status of the implementation, and various implementation details](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/current-status/)
that might affect you to gain a deeper understanding of how dynamic sampling works.
