---

Debug information files allow Sentry to extract stack traces and provide more
information about crash reports for most compiled platforms. Information stored
in debug files includes original function names, paths to source files and line
numbers, source code context, or the placement of variables in memory. Sentry
displays this information on the Issue Details page to help you triage an issue.

Each major platform uses different debug information files, as discussed in <PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/file-formats">our Debug File Formats content</PlatformLink>. We currently support the following formats:

- _dSYM files_ for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, and macOS
- _ELF symbols_ for Linux and Android (NDK)
- _PDB files_ for Windows
- _Breakpad symbols_ for all platforms
- _WASM files_ for WebAssembly
- _ProGuard mappings_ for Java and Android

Each of these formata .

<Note>

Source maps, while also being debug information files, are handled
differently in Sentry. For more information see [Source Maps in sentry-cli](/product/cli/releases/#sentry-cli-sourcemaps).

</Note>

Sentry requires access to debug information files of your application as well as
system libraries to provide fully symbolicated crash reports. You can either
[upload](./upload/) your files to Sentry or put them on a compatible
[Symbol Server](./symbol-servers/) to be downloaded by Sentry when needed.

Debug information files can be managed on the _Debug Files_ section in _Project
Settings_. This page lists all uploaded files and allows you to configure symbol
servers for automatic downloads.

ProGuard files can be managed on the _ProGuard_ section in _Project
Settings_. This page lists all uploaded files.
