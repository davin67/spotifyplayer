## A note on Django Channels

A Django application using [Channels 2.0](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) will be correctly instrumented under Python 3.7. For older versions of Python you'll have to install `aiocontextvars` from PyPI or your application will not start.

If you experience memory leaks in your channels consumers while using the SDK, you need to wrap your entire application in Sentry's [ASGI middleware](/platforms/python/guides/asgi/).

Unfortunately the SDK is not able to do so by itself, as [Channels is missing some hooks for instrumentation](https://github.com/django/channels/issues/1348).



## Options

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `DjangoIntegration()`:

- `transaction_style`:

  ```python
  def my_function(request):
      return "ok"

  urlpatterns = [
      url(r"^myurl/(?P<myid>\d+)/$", my_function)
  ]
  ```

  In the above code, you would set the transaction to:

  - `/myurl/{myid}` if you set `transaction_style="url"`. This matches the behavior of the old Raven SDK.
  - `my_function` if you set `transaction_style="function_name"`

  The default is `"url"`.

## Reporting other status codes

In some situations, it might make sense to report `404 Not Found` and other errors besides uncaught exceptions (`500 Internal Server Error`) to Sentry. You can achieve this by writing your own Django view for those status codes. For example:

```python

# urls.py

handler404 = 'mysite.views.my_custom_page_not_found_view'

# views.py

from django.http import HttpResponseNotFound
from sentry_sdk import capture_message


def my_custom_page_not_found_view(*args, **kwargs):
    capture_message("Page not found!", level="error")

    # return any response here, e.g.:
    return HttpResponseNotFound("Not found")
```

The error message you send to Sentry will have the usual request data attached.

Refer to [Customizing Error Views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/http/views/#customizing-error-views) from the Django documentation for more information.
