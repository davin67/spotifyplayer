Sentry supports un-minifying JavaScript via source maps, which lets you view source code context obtained from stack traces in their original untransformed form. This is particularly useful for debugging minified code (for example, UglifyJS), or transpiled code from a higher-level language (such as TypeScript and ES6).

## Capturing Source Maps

A native integration is provided to automatically publish source maps from Next.js.

Start by intalling `@sentry/next-source-maps`:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/next-source-maps
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/next-source-maps
```

From there you simply need to configure the plugin:

```javascript {filename:next.config.js}
const withSentrySourceMaps = require("@sentry/next-source-maps");

module.exports = withSentrySourceMaps({
  experimental: { plugins: true },
});
```
