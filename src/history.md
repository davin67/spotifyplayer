Sentry was born in 2010 at [Disqus](http://disqus.com) from an older project called `django-db-log`.

## The Naming of Sentry and Raven {#history-naming}

The origin of the names comes from our naming scheme at Disqus. If you dig around many of the open source repos (and some of the Sentry dependencies) you’ll see a common thread: StarCraft 2. Originally we started with the name Sentry representing a Protoss unit that had a shield, which was fairly fitting as Sentry helps shield you from problems, but doesn’t prevent them, just like the unit. When we named the first SDK we went with Raven, which represents a Terran air unit that also happens to place Sentry turrets.

tl;dr Sentry and Raven are StarCraft 2 units.
