<!-- TODO: needs translation to PHP (let's implement it first):


```php
{
  "transaction_context": {
    "name": string  # human-readable identifier, like "GET /users"
    "op": string  # short description of transaction type, like "pageload"
  },
  "parent_sampled": bool  # if this transaction has a parent, its sampling decision
  ...  # custom context as passed to `start_transaction`
}
``` -->
