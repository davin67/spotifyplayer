```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @next/plugin-sentry @sentry/next-source-maps
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @next/plugin-sentry @sentry/next-source-maps
```

You'll now have access to the `Sentry` instance via `@next/plugin-sentry`, which will seamlessly transition between `@sentry/node` and `@sentry/browser` depending on the Next.js scope:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@next/plugin-sentry";
```
