In JavaScript, you can use a function to modify the event or return a completely new one. If you return `null`, the event will be discarded.

```javascript {filename:_app.js}
import { clientConfig } from "@next/plugin-sentry";

clientConfig.beforeSend = event => {
  if (event.user) {
    // Don't send user's email address
    delete event.user.email;
  }
  return event;
};
```
