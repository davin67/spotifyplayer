If you're using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) you just need to install [Sentry's Vercel integration](/product/integrations/vercel/) and we'll automatically configure your environment for you.

Otherwise, you'll need to configure the following environment variables:

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN="___PUBLIC_DSN___"

NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_RELEASE="my-project-name@2.3.12"

# used for sourcemap publishing
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN="api-auth-token"
SENTRY_PROJECT="___PROJECT_SLUG___"
SENTRY_ORG="___ORG_SLUG___"
```

Lastly, enable generation and publishing of [source maps](sourcemaps/):

```javascript {filename:next.config.js}
const withSentrySourceMaps = require("@sentry/next-source-maps");

module.exports = withSentrySourceMaps({
  experimental: { plugins: true },
});
```
