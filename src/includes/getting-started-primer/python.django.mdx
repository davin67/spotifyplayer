**Sentry's Django integration enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions.**

<!--(TODO: 1) Make this font larger than the following text 2) sort out how to toggle on/off performance phrasing) -->

Sentry's Django integration reports all exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error and creates a separate scope for each request. The integration supports version 1.6 and above. Django applications using Channnels 2.0 will be correctly instrumented using Python 3.7. Older versions of Python require installation of `aiocontextvars`.

<!-- (TODO: Verify that this intro paragraph captures the two key things applicable to this integration) -->
