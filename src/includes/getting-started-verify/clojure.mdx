```clojure
(sentry/send-event {:message {:message "An event that is sent to Sentry"}}
```

Additional parameters are also supported on the `(sentry/sent-event)` function call,i.e.,

```clojure
(sentry/send-event {:message {:message "An event that is sent to Sentry"
                              :params ["param1" "param2"]
                              :level :error}
                    :throwable (RuntimeException.)})
```
