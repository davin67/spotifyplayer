It is possible to display a user's actual configuration information within code samples. This is done using one of the following keys:

<div data-user-token-list></div>

This feature only works within block level code examples, which are created using tripple tick <code>```</code> fenced code blocks in Markdown or using Jekyll's `highlight` tag.
